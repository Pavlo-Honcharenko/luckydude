                   Buying a Luckydude is simple (whether you've bought NFTs before or not) — just follow these steps:</div>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li class="list-li">
                     If you already have a crypto wallet, you'll need to have enough MATIC to purchase the Luckydude ($220 USD). You can purchase MATIC on Coinbase, or you can convert other cryptocurrencies you own into MATIC. Once you have the MATIC, make sure it's in the wallet that you're using to connect to the Luckydude site. Click «Mint» and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
                  <li class="list-li">
                     If you do not have a crypto wallet, the first step is to create one. The easiest method is to create a Coinbase account — from there, you can both buy MATIC and use the Coinbase wallet (with the new MATIC in it) to connect to the Luckydude site.

                   No – as of now, Luckydude is only transacting on the Polygon blockchain and you need to have MATIC coin in order to mint.  We've chosen Polygon to limit the gas fees you'll pay when minting Luckydudes and receiving your prizes.</div>

                   There are 7.75 billion people on earth. Some have money, some don't. Some have jobs, some don't. Some have good health, some don't. Some have close friends and family, some don't. Regardless of where you come from, what you do and what you have, <i>everyone</i> needs some good luck on their side.</span><span>
                   Luckydude is the universal token of good luck. Luckydudes holders benefit from increased positivity, health and prosperity — don't trust us, mint one and see for yourself. As an added bonus, every Tuesday and Friday one Luckydude is selected to receive a life-changing prize.</span><span>
                   So what's the <b>“Grand Vision”</b>?  Imagine that in the future 10 million people (0.13% of all people on earth) around the world own Luckydudes.  This means that every Tuesday and Friday, $50M will be distributed to the winning Luckydudes.  That's $100M per week, or $5.2B per year transferred to the winning Luckydudes.  We believe Luckydude is positioned to become the most exciting opportunity for wealth transfer in the world — completely secure, transparent and on a global scale.</span>
